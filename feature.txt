Our own designed feature is that we add two filter to the web page.
There are two filter dropbox to select a specific Region and/or Government type to view the dependancy graph between life and GDP of the countries filtered by these conditions.
p.s. 
1.Default options in these two boxes will give all the countries.
2.After using the filter funcion, you can either look up the graph in a specific year you like or just let it do the animation.
